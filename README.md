# Convolutional-Neural-Network
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. The cnn architecture uses a special technique called Convolution instead of relying solely on matrix multiplications like traditional neural networks. Convolutional networks use a process called convolution, which combines two functions to show how one changes the shape of the other.
